The kayak is low to the water like a canoe, and the kayaker uses a two-sided paddle to push the boat through the water.</p>\n\n<p>Wind surfing is a combination between surfing and sailing, in which the surfer stands on a board on the surface of the water and moves around the water using the wind and a sail. The Western world did not begin windsurfing until the later half of the 20th century, but Polynesians have been riding the waves with a stand up board and a sail for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Stand up Paddleboarding, abbreviated SUP, originated in Hawaii and was first documented in 2013. This sport involves a board similar to a surf board but often bigger, and a canoe which is used to propel the boarder through water.</p>"
