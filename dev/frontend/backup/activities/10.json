Aided by flippers on the feet, swimming with the face underwater allows the swimmer to observe wildlife such as fish and sea plants.</p>\n\n<p>Scuba diving is another recreational sport similar to snorkeling but with a self-contained breathing apparatus not connected to the surface air. Scuba divers also wear masks and flippers, in addition to a tank of pressurized air, which allows the swimmer to breath underwater at any depth. Scuba divers are able to see marine life in the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>"
