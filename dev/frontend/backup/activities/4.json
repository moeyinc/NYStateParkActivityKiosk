Enjoy the steady silence and crisp air of winter as you move through the snow on skis or by snowshoe.</p>\n\n<p>The snowshoe functions by displacing an individuals weight across a wider area so one does not sink into deep snow. Snowshoes were commonly used by Indigenous people throughout North American before the arrival of Europeans, however the shape and size of snowshoe could vary from group to group. Snowshoeing allows more versatility over the snow to allow hikers to traverse terrain with deep snow.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-country skiing is another popular recreational sport for traversing more easily across deep snows. Cross-country skiing is said to have developed in Scandanivia but is now practiced worldwide. At the Winter Olympics, several events involve cross-country skiing.</p>"
