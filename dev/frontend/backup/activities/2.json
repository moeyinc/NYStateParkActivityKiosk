            "raw_html_text" : "<p>Hallock State Park Preserve is an important migratory bird site. Birds that are heading South for the winter, or returning North will pass through Hallock Park. Within the park, birds find food and rest to restore their energy for the long journey. Tree swallows enjoy berries from the Bayberry tree, while other birds enjoy the freshwater from Hallock Pond before crossing the Sound.</p>\n\n<p>Hallock Park Preserve is a unique site for birding because of it&rsquo;s mix of both shorefront and forest. Common Tern, Leasttern, Piping Plover and the ubiquitous Seagull are some of the birds you might see by the shore.</p>\n\n<p>Several kinds of Warbler and Swallow can be found within the park, such as Prairie Warbler, Common Yellowthroat Warbler, Bank Swallows, and Savannah Sparrows. The Osprey has also been sighted within the park hunting fish, its exclusive diet.</p>\n\n<p>The park represents an important site for these birds to rest when migrating, and for many to make their home and breed here during the summer. Dedicated natural spaces like Hallock Park Preserve are a vital piece of the overall ecosystem and the global bird population.</p>"
